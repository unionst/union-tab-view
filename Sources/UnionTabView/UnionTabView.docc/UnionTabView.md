# ``UnionTabView``

A SwiftUI package that brings iOS 26's Liquid Glass tab bar with fully custom tab item views to your apps.

## Overview

UnionTabView gives you the beautiful floating glass effect of iOS 26's native tab bar while allowing you to use any custom SwiftUI view for tab items—including profile pictures, custom icons, animated badges, and more.

The standard iOS 26 `TabView` only supports system-provided tab items. UnionTabView solves this limitation by recreating the liquid glass aesthetic with full `@ViewBuilder` support, giving you complete creative control over your tab bar appearance.
